5. **How do you manage state in a React component?**
   - Use the `useState` hook in functional components or initialize state in class components and use `this.setState`.

6. **What are props in React, and how are they used?**
   - Props are short for properties and are used for passing data from parent to child components. They are accessed as function arguments in functional components and via `this.props` in class components.

7. **Discuss the React component lifecycle.**
   - The component lifecycle includes mounting, updating, and unmounting phases. Key methods are `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
